# CodeWithMe ðŸš€

A playful React application that gives users no choice but to embark on their coding journey! When presented with "Do you want to code with me?", trying to click "No" becomes an entertaining challenge as the button escapes the cursor. Meanwhile, choosing "Yes" directs users to GeeksForGeeks to start their learning adventure.

## Features âœ¨

- Interactive UI with a mischievous twist
- Impossible-to-click "No" button that dodges cursor attempts
- Direct link to GeeksForGeeks learning resources
- Built with React for smooth interactions
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
